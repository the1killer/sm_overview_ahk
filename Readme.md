# Deprecated !!!
This method for generating an overview map has been succeeded by my tile based overview map: https://github.com/the1killer/sm_overview

# INSTRUCTIONS

!!!! BACKUP YOUR SAVE, not responsible for any issues !!!!

1. **Really backup your save!**
1. Install [AutoHotKey]
1. Enable dev mode in SurvivalGame.lua, change `if g_survivalDev then`  to  `if true then` around line 84 after function **SurvivalGame.client_onCreate**
1. Add /tp command to SurvivalGame.lua (see [SurvivalGame.lua](./SurvivalGame.lua)):
    - add /tp to list of chat commands ~line 130
    - add /tp handler ~line 529, before block of commands starting with **elseif params[1] == "/clearpathnodes**
1. Reload save if already in game.
1. Set FOV to 90, see makemap.ahk for other quality settings (alternates for FOV 70 and 90)
1. Use Borderless Window Mode, disable Depth of Field, recommended turn everything down to low besides view distance
1. If you resolution is NOT 1080p look at lines 26-34 of the AHK file and change to suit your resolution or choose 1440p by commenting out the 1080p section
1. Make sure Geforce Experience hotkey is **NOT alt+z**, this is so we can hide in game UI
1. Make sure you have nothing in your toolbar 0 slot or 5 slot.... 
    - Sometimes the tp command hits 5 even though command is sent fine
1. Make sure **/god** is on for godmode incase of falling and stops hunger/thirst
1. Make sure you use **/day** to set 12:00 time and no time progression for best looking terrain. If you want night you could do /timeofday 1 and /timeprogress off
1. Double click makemap.ahk script to load the script
1. Press 5 or 0 or any other empty slot on your toolbar to remove tool from view
1. Hit Shit+F1 to start the script, Dont touch your mouse and keyboard until its done
1. Will show a popup "Map Done!" when its finished
1. Open html/index.html to view your map


## Some things to note
- Shift + F2 to reload the script if you make changes, or to stop it while generating
- Terrain height especially along edges of images will cause lines to not match up
- I reccomended you restart your game between map generations, seems to be a memory leak and FPS slow down.
- Game updates will remove the lua changes, requiring you to re-add them
- Sometimes the teleport will get stuck in a loop if your body goes into ragdoll
- If your machine takes a while to render the tiles after teleport change the delay on line ~101  `Sleep, 4000`
